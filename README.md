This is the source code of the firmware for the stationary electronic clock with NTP client.
The heart of the clock is Arch Pro development board with MCU LPC1768 from NXP (Cortex-M3 core). It's required additional
board with DS3231 as RTC, and MAX7219 as display controller.
Project was developed in Keil uVision 5 IDE (CMSIS-RTOS RTX, MDK-Pro as IP stack).
